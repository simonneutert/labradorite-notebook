# Labradorite Notebook (work in progress)

> Labradorite rightfully belongs to the group of wisdom crystals, because it promotes a free flow of mental energy as it awakens intuition and allows us to get mentally unstuck.

## Rationale

Most Notetaking apps do either too much (Notion), too less (Apple Notes) or locked me in (Evernote).

I wanted something that does **just-enough**â„¢. Let me try and wrap it up in a few bullets:

- hide the clutter, I don't want to see all the old stuff I may not need anymore
- a search that shows me snips in the notes, not just the notes I should dig in
- simple tagging support
- ownership of the notes: markdown, yaml, attachments all in one place in directories

## Architecture

Little experiment on how it rolls:

- POST sends/gets JSON
- GET gets HTML
- navigating using HTML a tags

## Folder Structure

- lib: Library Code / Business Logic
- views: ERB Views
- memos: the Memos/Notes in subdirectories `YYYY/MM/DD/random-string`
- public: css/js/media
- .tantiny: the local index data created by the [tantiny](https://github.com/baygeldin/tantiny) gem

## Major Dependencies

- Roda
- Tantiny
- RedCarpet
