# Labradorite Notebook

> Labradorite rightfully belongs to the group of wisdom crystals, because it promotes a free flow of mental energy as it awakens intuition and allows us to get mentally unstuck.

## Rationale

Most Notetaking apps do either too much (Notion), too less (Apple Notes) or locked me in (Evernote).

I wanted something that does **just-enough**â„¢, in the spirit of a *flat file cms*. Let me try and wrap it up in a few bullets:

* **ownership** of the notes (flat files)  
  markdown, yaml, attachments all in one place in directories
* **easy** on the eyes/mind  
  I don't want to see all the old stuff I may not need anymore
* a search that shows me **snips** in the notes  
  not just the notes in a sidebar
* a very simple **tagging** support
* basic **file uploads**  
  keeping the originals side by side with notes

I like to keep things simple, so I once again fell for [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net) as the Web Layer. [Tantiny](https://github.com/baygeldin/tantiny) is the kicker for this project. I was curious, if I could come up with something useful quickly, not having to deal with a complicated setup or Postgres as a requirement.

## Technical Prerequisites

* Ruby v3.0.x ready to roll
* Install a stable version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)

## Architecture

Little experiment on how it rolls:

* all GET gets HTML
* all POST sends FORMS/JSON gets JSON back
* all links/navigation are plain HTML `a` tags ðŸ¤¯

## Folder Structure

* `lib`: Library Code / Business Logic
* `views`: ERB Views
* `memos`: the Memos/Notes in subdirectories `YYYY/MM/DD/random-string`
* `public`: css/js/media
* `.tantiny`: the local index data created by the [tantiny](https://github.com/baygeldin/tantiny) gem

## Major Dependencies

* Roda
* Tantiny
* RedCarpet

## Run/Deploy with Docker

The included `Dockerfile` and the `docker-compose.yml` are more a stub to build upon.

Currently the Dockerfile support passing the USERNAME as an `build-arg`.

- `$ docker build . --build-arg USERNAME=$(whoami) -t labba`
- `$ docker run --rm -p9292:9292 labba`

Either this way, or you adapt the Dockerfile to your needs.

Let's say your username on the server you run (or your machine) is `johndoe`, then your Dockerfile should look something like this:

```Dockerfile
# in your version of the Dockerfile, replace labradorite at the ARG USERNAME
ARG USERNAME=johndoe
```

That will help you both secure the service and have the files being created with the proper rights on the host system.

### Docker Compose

build and/or up using: `USERNAME=$(whoami) docker-compose build`

**Volumes**

- this `memos` directory has all your created content in it. Having it mounted from your host should make easy for you to backup (if you don't use a private gitrepo for that ðŸ˜‰)
- fyi: having tantiny's index (`.tantiny`) as a volume has no benefit. Beware, it can easily have a negative impact.

## Development

- `$ rake test` runs the test suite
- `$ rake reset` resets the files to the defaults (e.g. for testing)
