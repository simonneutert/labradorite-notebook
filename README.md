## Rationale

Most Notetaking apps do either too much (Notion), too little (Apple Notes) and lock me in (all options ever).

I wanted something that does **just-enough**â„¢, in the spirit of a _flat file cms_. Let me try and wrap it up in a few bullets:

- **ownership** of the notes (flat files)  
  markdown, yaml, attachments all in one place in directories
- **easy** on the eyes/mind  
  I don't want to see all the old stuff I may not need anymore
- a search that shows me **snips** in the notes  
  not just the notes in a sidebar
- a very simple **tagging** support
- basic **file uploads**  
  keeping the originals side by side with notes

I like to keep things simple, so I once again fell for [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net) as the Web Layer. [Tantiny](https://github.com/baygeldin/tantiny) is the kicker for this project. I was curious, if I could come up with something useful quickly, not having to deal with a complicated setup or Postgres as a requirement.

## Technical Prerequisites

- Ruby v3.x are tested and ready to roll
- Install a stable version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)

## Architecture

Little experiment on how it rolls:

- all GET gets HTML
- all POST sends FORMS/JSON gets JSON back
- all links/navigation are plain HTML `a` tags ðŸ¤¯

## Folder Structure

- `lib`: Library Code / Business Logic
- `views`: ERB Views
- `memos`: the Memos/Notes in subdirectories `YYYY/MM/DD/random-string`
- `public`: css/js/media
- `.tantiny`: the local index data created by the [tantiny](https://github.com/baygeldin/tantiny) gem

## Major Dependencies

- Roda
- Tantiny
- RedCarpet

## Run/Deploy with Docker

The included `Dockerfile` and the `docker-compose.yml` are more a stub to build upon.

Currently the Dockerfile support passing the USERNAME as an `build-arg`.

- `$ docker build . --build-arg USERNAME=$(whoami) -t labba`
- `$ docker run --rm -p9292:9292 labba`

Either this way, or you adapt the Dockerfile to your needs.

Let's say your username on the server you run (or your machine) is `johndoe`, then your Dockerfile should look something like this:

```Dockerfile
# in your version of the Dockerfile, replace labradorite at the ARG USERNAME
ARG USERNAME=johndoe
```

That will help you both secure the service and have the files being created with the proper rights on the host system.

### Docker Compose

build and/or up using: `$ USERNAME=$(whoami) docker-compose build`

**Volumes**

- this `memos` directory has all your created content in it. Having it mounted from your host should make easy for you to backup (if you don't use a private gitrepo for that ðŸ˜‰)
- fyi: having tantiny's index (`.tantiny`) as a volume has no benefit. Beware, it can easily have a negative impact.

## Development

From v0.5.0 on, the project can only be run native on a Linux machine or in a Docker container. See the Dockerfiles and `justfile` for more information.

- `$ rake test` runs the test suite
- `$ rake reset_default_memos` resets the files to the repos defaults (e.g. for testing)
- `$ rake reset_memos` clears ALL memos

Before pushing code, you should always run `rake reset` and `rake test`,  
**therefore have a repo you work on AND another you use JUST for running the software.**

## Run it

Example docker-compose file:

```docker-compose
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    user: "${UID}:${GID}"
    environment:
      - USERNAME=yourusername # REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR VPS user's USERNAME
    image: ghcr.io/simonneutert/labradorite-notebook:v0.2.0
    # ports:
    #  - 9292:9292
    command: bundle exec rackup -o0 -Eproduction
    volumes:
      - ./memos:/home/labradorite/memos:cached
```
